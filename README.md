# Tempestuous-Turrets
My two friends and I developed a 4-player local co-op game using the Unity engine for the Hack the North 2022 hackathon. We deployed the application using Git as source control, manually uploading web versions of the build files generated using Unity's automated system, on Azure to make them publicly accessible. Furthermore, I engineered all of the front-end design, programming gameplay elements, sound design, and original asset creation from scratch.

Go to [tempestuousturrets.tech](http://tempestuousturrets.tech/) to try it out! The website runs the game well and gives you a chance to play it, but for an even better experience, we highly recommend that you download the game on your local machine. NOTE: To download it and play it, it is critical you have Unity installed along with the corresponding environment set up and ready to go.
